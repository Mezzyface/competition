# Project Documentation Index

This folder contains documentation to help AI assistants and developers understand and work with the codebase.

## Documentation Structure

### 📋 `/task` - Implementation Plans & PRDs
Contains implementation plans and product requirement documents for features. Reference these when implementing similar functionality.

### 🏗️ `/system` - System Architecture
High-level documentation about project structure, design patterns, and architectural decisions:
- Project structure and folder organization
- Reactive UI pattern usage
- Simulation/View separation architecture
- Scene management system
- Theme and styling system

### 📖 `/sops` - Standard Operating Procedures
Step-by-step guides for common tasks:
- Creating new UI screens
- Creating reusable game systems
- Adding new game data

## Quick Start

1. **Before implementing a feature**: Read relevant system docs and check for similar implementations in `/task`
2. **After implementing a feature**: Create an implementation plan in `/task` for future reference
3. **When you find a pattern**: Document it as an SOP in `/sops`

## Documentation Guidelines

- Keep documentation concise and actionable
- Update docs when architectural patterns change
- Use markdown format for all documentation
- Include code examples where helpful
